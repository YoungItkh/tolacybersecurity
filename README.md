I am passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy contributing to solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves.
I have found that today we all need protection as technology is rapidly evolving, and at the same time, a lot of new and creative tactics that are used by the attackers are becoming more difficult to defend without a counterattack.
